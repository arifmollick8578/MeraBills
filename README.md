This is part of an assignment given by MeraBills [Assignment details](https://github.com/arifmollick8578/MeraBills/blob/master/MeraBills%20assignment.pdf). In this repository I have implemented basic features asked for the assignment, included few user level interaction elements, and keep code simpler without using any prior 3rd party API. 

The complete code is written in JAVA as instructed on the assignment.
